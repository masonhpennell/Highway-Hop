# Highway Hop

A fun driving game made in pygame that plays like "Subway Surfers"

## Description

This is an interactive game made using pygame module for interaction and OpenGL for graphics. The program was mostly constructed with OpenGL primitives and a few 3D Objects from online resources.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* python 3.8
* anaconda

### Installing

1. Clone the Repo or Download folder
```
git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
```
2. Create Conda Environment
```
conda create -n NAME python=3.8.20
```

### Executing program

```
python game.py
```

## How to Play

* To beat the game, you must reach the end of the track before time runs out, while collecting enough coins. You also have to avoid the traffic cones, as hitting one will stun you for a bit. Obstacles and coins will be placed randomly each time you play, so each session is a different experience.

* To control the car, use the **left and right arrow keys**. You can move between five lanes to avoid cones and get coins.

* Use the **P key** to pause the game.

* After the game ends, you can move the camera around and zoom in on the car. **Use the left and right arrow keys**.

## Known Bugs

* Coins may be placed in areas that are unreachable (like inside obstacles).
